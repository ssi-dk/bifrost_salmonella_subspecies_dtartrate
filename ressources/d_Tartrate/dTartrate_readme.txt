When running the srst2_d_Tartrate.fasta database in srst2, make sure you open the pileup file after the run and check position 10 in the sequence.
If position 10 has a SNP and it is T instead of C, then the strain is dT- and a ParatyphiB or other non-Tartrate fermenting strain.
Position is known from Malorny et al 2003.
